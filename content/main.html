<h2>Welcome to this Unofficial Phaser 3 tutorial site.</h2>
<p>This site has been created to provide a unified place for tutorials to be available when Phaser 3 gets released. These are tutorials on <i>how to make games</i> with Phaser 3, and not for the actual development of the engine.</p>

<h3>For starting out with Phaser 3: <a onclick="loadPage('quick-start')">Quick Start Guide</a></h3>

<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>To help out with this project, you can write tutorials, as I have seen in a few places on the internet already. All you have to do is clone the repo from GitHub, create an HTML file in the content folder, and write your tutorial in there. <a onclick="loadPage('meta/example')">Here is an example page</a>. Then, just create a pull request to add your changes to the site.</p>
<p>Any other changes to this site are welcome, just submit a PR.</p>
